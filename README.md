# C--Projects
 A repository for all of my projects written in C#.
 It includes test programs and more complex builds.
 The TwentyOne and CarInsuranceFinal are my favorites.
 TwentyOne is a console app blackjack game.
 CarInsuranceFinal is an MVC web application that mimics a car insurance website. It takes user input on policy information and calculates a qoute based on business logic.
